How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  -To make sure my program is functional and secure I have my own process of checks and balances. I
  make sure my code is consistent and efficient by double checking my work, taking frequent breaks and
  running test for every function of my code.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  -The users need are most important when it comes to creating a program and I incorporate their vision
  by making a list of all their requirements and revsiting that list multiple times to make sure I hit every
  aspect the program needs.
How do I approach designing software?
  -When approaching a new software design I try to approach with a fresh mindset and open minded to what 
  requirements the customer is requesting.
